Description: Flat Blocks is a modern “Flat 2.0” style theme built from the ground up with WordPress "Full Site Editing" support, a versatile color palette, dozens of block patterns and alternate layouts and color schemes. LATEST UPDATE: Updated minimum WordPress version required to 6.7 which coupled with simplifying CSS throughout significantly reduced the amount of CSS needed by over 25%. The theme now only loads the CSS styles needed for each page and instructs WordPress to also do this, which further reduces the amount of CSS for most pages. Added 5 new gradients based on the recent duotones that were added. Changed Larger and Extra Large font slugs to match the TwentyTwentyFive theme.
Requires at least: 6.7
Tested up to: 6.7
