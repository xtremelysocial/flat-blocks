Description: Flat Blocks PRO is a modern “Flat 2.0” style theme built from the ground up with WordPress "Full Site Editing" support, a versatile color palette, dozens of block patterns and alternate layouts and color schemes. LATEST UPDATE: Updated minimum WordPress version required to 6.7 which coupled with simplifying CSS throughout significantly reduced the amount of CSS needed by over 25%. The theme now only loads the CSS styles needed for each page and instructs WordPress to also do this. Added 5 new gradients based on the recent duotones that were added. Changed some font sizes to match the TwentyTwentyFive theme. Miscellaneous enhancements and fixes.
